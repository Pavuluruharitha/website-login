    <p>One of the most recently discovered ruins, the Incan ruins of Machu Picchu continue to astound historians, archaeologists and historical enthusiasts alike. A mystery of its real purpose surrounds the place and historians till date continue to debate on the matter. A hotspot within the ruins itself, The Temple of the Sun is known for having windows perfectly positioned to let the rays of the sun inside in intricate patterns. Apart from the archaeological site itself, the panoramic view of the Huayna Picchu peak is a breathtaking sight you can never forget. Adventure seekers can also trek along the beautiful Inca trails which offer the most honest experience of Peru's Incan heritage. Machu Picchu is packed throughout the year, but once you experience it yourself, you cannot help but want to keep going back for more.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:center">Iceland-for the offbeat traveller</h2>
<p>Amongst the most coveted travel destinations, Iceland is one of the most surreal and magnificent countries in the world. Located close to the Arctic Circle, it offers amazingly dramatic and breath-taking landscapes and exotic natural phenomena. Summer is the best time to visit, owing to the mild temperatures and a plethora of available activities from hiking fjords to playing golf at midnight. However, no time is a bad time to visit this spectacular snow-covered country.

<p>Taj Mahal, also spelled Tadj Mahall, mausoleum complex in Agra, western Uttar Pradesh state, northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628) to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s most famous and widely recognized building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.

    In its harmonious proportions and its fluid incorporation of decorative elements, the Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), lovely gardens, and a museum. One of the most beautiful structural compositions in the world, the Taj Mahal is also one of the world’s most iconic monuments, visited by millions of tourists each year. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983.From time to time the Taj Mahal has been subject to India’s political dynamics. Night viewing was banned there between 1984 and 2004 because it was feared that the monument would be a target of Sikh militants. In addition, it increasingly has come to be seen as an Indian cultural symbol. Some Hindu nationalist groups have attempted to diminish the importance of the Muslim influence in accounting for the origins and design of the Taj Mahal.

    Munnar Tourism</h2></b></center>
    <p>Famous for the tea estates, greenery, winding roads, blanket of mist, and viewpoints, Munnar is a hill station in Kerala, located in the Idukki district. Lying in the Western Ghats at 1600 metres, it is one of the most sought after and visited travel destinations globally, especially popular amongst honeymooners.
    
    Once the summer resort of the erstwhile British government, the main reason to visit Munnar is to explore the sprawling tea plantations and the exotic flora and fauna. The Eravikulam National Park, Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary and tea plantations are its major attractions. Munnar is also famous for being home to the rare Neelakurinji flowers that bloom once in 12 years (the next bloom is in 2030) and the endangered Nilgiri Tahr.
    
    Munnar is divided into Old Munnar, where the tourist information office is, and Munnar, where the bus station and most guest houses are located. It is also an ideal place for trekking, camping, paragliding and boating. As it's a hilly region, Jeep safari is also a popular activity to experience. Munnar is often visited along with Alleppey and Thekkady, the two most popular tourist destinations in Kerala.
    
    The hill station is a haven for shopping for tea and spices. Cardamom, ginger, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, coffee and a variety of homemade chocolates can be bought from the number of shops spread across the hill town.

                </h2></b></center>
                <p>Pinpointing the most beautiful Seychellois beach is like splitting hairs, but Anse Source d'Argent gets extremely high marks for its sugar-white sand framed by dramatic granite boulders and sparkling aquamarine water. The sweet shoreline is relatively secluded from the resort crowds on La Digue Island.
                    This magical, misty, and well-preserved cloud forest in northwestern Costa Rica is the ultimate template for sustainable ecotourism. Along with its sister cloud forest, Santa Elena Reserve, Monteverde is a practically untouched paradise home to thousands of plant, animal, and bird species (including the radiant quetzal), visible from jungle paths and nail-biting steel bridges hanging over the canopy.
